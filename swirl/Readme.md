<p>
  Swirl is a base-R-tutorial within R itself.<br>

  It is good for beginners <br>
  For me it was a bit basic, so I moved on. <br>

  <b>Good points</b>
  <ul>
  <li>Clear explanation</li>
  <li>You can choose the subject you want to learn about</li>
  <li>You can't skip things within exercises when you get stuck</li>
  </ul>

  <b>Bad points</b>
  <ul>
  <li>When you write something slightly wrong, it's wrong (My answer: numbers <- 4*3; Wrong the good answer is: number <- 4*3). </li>
  <li>You can't skip things within exercises when it's to slow</li>
  <li>Real basic</li>
  </ul>
</p>
