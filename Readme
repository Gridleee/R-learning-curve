<h1>
My learning process
</h1>




<h2>
Reasoning
</h2>
<p>
I got the idea of learning R from my internship.
It was not a liability form the project, but it would make it more extensive.
For the internship I had to design a Power BI setting.
Power BI has a wide arrange of visualization possibilities, but they are quit limited.
That's where my interest in R began.

Now I know the posibilities of R, I'm even more driven to learn it.
