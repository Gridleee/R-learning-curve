To be sure I have clean data, I will use the datasets from R base.

I found this sheet about machine learing: https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/YanchangZhao-refcard-data-mining.pdf <br>
So for now I limed myself to this sheets recemandations.

Lets start

Libraries:
```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
#instal

```


```{r}
#add

```

Now letsstart trying things.

```{r}
#regression
q <- lm(cars$speed ~ cars$dist, cars)


```
